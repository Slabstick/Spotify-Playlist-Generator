# My First React App
## A simple Spotify playlist generator

I started learning React 3 days ago and I really don't have a clue of what I'm doing. This App is a project on codecademy and most of it doesn't really make sense to me. I started learning JS a few months ago, learned java, html and css and thought that it was all very - moderately - easy until I met React.

The problem is: with all of the above I could learn for hours on end and still get things into my brain but with react, I'm just tilted after a few hours which is really frustrating so I am adapting my learning habits. From now on everytime I realize React is making my brain hurt I go back to the basics. For example: today I just started watching the first few minutes of a 12 hour tutorial on react over on youtube because a) I can refresh the "basics" of react of which I am always misremembering or just plain not remembering (eg. using return in the render methods of my components) and b) I reflect on how far I have come.

I'll try to use github as a diary because learning is hard and even harder if you forget where you started and how bad you once were. I would have started this sooner but I first had to learn how to use git and github.
