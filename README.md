I started learning React 3 days ago and I really don't have a clue of what I'm doing. This App is a project on codecademy and most of it doesn't really make sense to me. I started learning JS a few months ago, learned java, html and css and thought that it was all very - moderately - easy until I met React.

The problem is: with all of the above I could learn for hours on end and still get things into my brain but with react, I'm just tilted after a few hours which is really frustrating so I am adapting my learning habits. From now on everytime I realize React is making my brain hurt I go back to the basics. For example: today I just started watching the first few minutes of a 12 hour tutorial on react over on youtube because a) I can refresh the "basics" of react of which I am always misremembering or just plain not remembering at all (eg. using return in the render methods of my components) and b) I reflect on how far I have come.

I'll try to use github as a diary because learning is hard and even harder if you forget where you started and how bad you once were. I would have started this sooner but I first had to learn how to use git and github.

Gotta be honest, all that API Stuff I really didn't get. Like at all. I had a few lessons with fetch(), async and await and resolve and all that good stuff but I am really not fluid with it. This lesson here wasn't really about that so I mostly ignored it and just wrote what the walkthrough said. Also some stuff I tried again with too much force. I was really banging my head today. But the first few hours at least were really productive. And then in the end I also had a few epiphanies while debugging.

Bugs were really dumb I have to say. Like a missing 'https' or 'cpm' instead of '.com'. But that also means I learned that it doesn't really mean anything when the console says it's some 'CORS' error. It was just me missing one 's' in 'https'.

I don't think I have all the React stuff down, but at least I got a little bit better today. Especially with debugging. Which is something.

And it works. It finally works in the end. Now I have a working version of my first react app and next time I can always come back to look at it. Would have been better if the project had some Lifecycle methods because it is lacking all of these and instead has a lot of API stuff in it that I really didn't care about, but on the other hand I will need it at some point so I won't cry about it.

I'm really not looking forward to API communication though...
